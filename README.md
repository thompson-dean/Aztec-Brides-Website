### Band Website 

TO DO:
2) Check home style hamburger menu on mobile
  Make it on the left, and then clickable so that the menu pops out from the left(?)
3) Check member pages on browser / mobile 
4) Make playlist on homepage
5) Make AJAX style website so that music plays throughout the page
6) Update the merch page - add a basket or some kind of way to order?
7) Figure out page size issues / image overflow - probably something to do with the fact that the buttons in the header nav bar are  overflowing but invisible. Could be a Visualizer bug
8) Make the "Socials" button also slide down, while maintaining the top margin of the overall menu when active
